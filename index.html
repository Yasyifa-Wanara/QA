        <p>I hope you to feel better each day. I might still be a burdensome little sister. But I hope you won't leave me alone too fast. I felt lonely without you (but sometimes you are way too scary). You are the only sister I have in this world. I actually really love you but things could also getting worse, but it doesn't mean that you can't make it. Hang on gagak!
        </p>
        <p>Happy Birthday!</p>
